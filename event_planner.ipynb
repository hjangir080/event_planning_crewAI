We’ve catered numerous tech launches, new software reveals, and other grand opening events. Our personalized services have allowed us to work with major companies like Google, for example, to create a launch party for a suite of new platforms. No matter what you have in mind for your launch, our team specializes in making your unveiling spectacular.\n",
      "Recently, we completed a product launch for a client. We had interactive chef stations in their showroom. One chef was rolling vegan sushi. At the other, the chef used a smoking gun and glass domes to create genuinely creative menu options. Our client LOVED the stations and we designed a delicious menu to create a unique, different, and interactive experience.\n",
      "Open the doors of a new company, unveil a new housing project, throw an awards ceremony, or bring in the mayor of the city to help with fundraising. No matter what your vision may be, our team will help you plan and execute the perfect event. We love taking part in these special moments.\n",

Our trusted, experienced company catering team will listen to your vision and go out of its way to ensure every detail of your cocktail party is perfect.\n",
      "One of our favorite cocktail parties was a cocktail reception we catered for a long term client. During this event, we offered specialty caviar, and coordination of outside vendors on-site and in advance.\n",
      "Utilizing our comprehensive event production services, we met with the venue contact in advance to walk the space and plan the seating and layout. We also met with the primary client representative and his friends and accommodated last-minute requests to create an upscale, unforgettable event. In the end, our client was thrilled with the outcome.\n",

      "We specialize in creating magical holiday events that are the most memorable parties of the year. Regardless of throwing a brunch, dinner, cocktail party, or wine and dessert pairing, our team will rock your party.\n",
      "Recently, we held an 800 person holiday party at The Regency. For this event, the client requested passed stationary appetizers. We also handled numerous last-minute additions regarding rentals, flowers, lighting, and more. We started our planning for this event with a lengthy site visit where we walked the space. Through linen colors, flower arrangements, and lighting, we created a beautiful event around a rich burgundy holiday color theme. Our guests loved the food, and the party was exactly what they’d imagined!\n",
      "Come to Left Coast Catering for professional party planning and catering for your upcoming holiday parties. We’ll design a festive specialized menu your guests will enjoy.

      "We specialize in listening to our clients needs and helping them recreate their vision. The resulting events are always exactly what the client had in mind. We offer custom menus and can accommodate gluten-free or vegan diets, as well as any other specialized menu request.\n",
      "Recently, we catered a large conference for a business client here in San Francisco. To help the client bring their dream to life, we coordinated specialty rentals, identified cost-savings wherever we could, developed specialized menus (mostly vegan, but we included vegetarian, and gluten-free options as well), scheduled staff familiar with the event and venue, researched what worked and what didn’t from previous years, and helped them with the venue search. Our goal is to make the entire process from planning to execution as easy as possible for our clients.\n",
      "No matter if it’s a small affair or a party meant for five hundred people, we will develop the perfect menu, design the look, and lighting to make it beautiful. If you’re hosting a conference, you know it’s a significant branding opportunity for your company, and we’ll help maximize the opportunity for you.\n",
